# Purpose

<p>This archetype allows you to create a basic spring application to be able to create it and start working as fast as 
possible. I am aware that some of its defined dependencies might not be suitable for everyone, but this is for personal 
use.
<br>Although it is for personal use it will be improved and if anyone wants to request a change you can do so at this 
project board.<br> Add link here <br>

> Those request will be answered as fast as possible, but I might decide not to implement them if they 
are not suitable for my purposes. In that case you can just create a fork.


# Usage

<p>Since it is just a simple archetype you just have to do the same as in any other archetype. But in case someone needs
some guidance I leave here the way to use it:</p>

<ol>
    <li>CLone this project</li>
    <li>Install in your local maven installation by using: <i>mvn install</i> </li>
    <li>From now on just</li>
</ol>

 <table>
  <tr>
    <th>Action</th>
    <th>Command</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Clone this project</td>
    <td>git clone add-url</td>
  </tr>
</table>
